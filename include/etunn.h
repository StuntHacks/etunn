 * @mainpage EtuNN library documentation - index
 *
 * The intention behind this library was to provide a simple and easy to use (thus the name) C++ library for neural networks and genetic algorithms.<br />
 * It supports evolutionary neural networks, feedforward neural networks, LSTMs and some more (see @ref networkTypes "Types of neural networks" for more information).
 *
 * <div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong> This project is still in beta and was coded by only one guy who just wanted to try some stuff he learned in school. <br />If you find any bug please report it via the <a href="https://github.com/StuntHacks/etunn" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</div>
